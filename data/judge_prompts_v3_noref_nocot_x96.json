He is thoroughly charming, but the bookstore owner seems (at least superficially) immune to this; which paradoxically provokes a genuine attraction and derails the charm offensive.

It looked exactly as it had every autumn of his life—the cedar shingles silvered with age, the porch sagging gently under weight of winters past—but the air felt thicker, somehow, as if the woods had leaned in closer, waiting. He thought maybe he was just tired. Maybe it was nothing more than the long drive north, cramped in the back of the truck beside his older brother Mike -- and a stack of rifles wrapped in oily canvas. Still, the feeling lingered.\n\nThe first caribou they found that season hadn't bolted. It had just watched, ears flicking lazily, waiting for the shot. JT had felt a crawling in his gut watching it die, noticing how it fell with a quiet dignity—as though it had wanted nothing more. Nobody else seemed to find it odd, or at least they didn't say so. JT kept his mouth shut. Always safer that way.\n\nThen there was the moment in the clearing. JT had fallen behind, fumbling with bootlaces stiff from the cold, and by the time he'd caught up with his father and brother, they'd already stopped. JT slowed instinctively, ducking behind a tangle of brush, staring out into the open space where a massive buck stood utterly still, chest rising and falling in slow, deep breaths. The animal looked…wrong, somehow. Maybe it was the eyes—dark and flat, calm in a way that made JT's neck prickle. Or maybe it was something deeper, something in the way the buck stood close enough for his father to reach out and touch it.\n\nJT watched as his father raised a trembling hand toward the animal's muzzle. His father's face had a strange expression, eyes too bright, lips parted slightly, like he was on the verge of whispering something—a secret, maybe. The rifle hung uselessly at his side, forgotten. Mike had the same dazed look in his eyes.  JT's breath stopped short, his mind suddenly shouting at him to look away, turn around, just run—but he couldn't move.\n\nAnd then, as suddenly as it had begun, it was over. The buck shivered, startled by something unseen, and disappeared into the brush without so much as a sound. The two of them looked around, confused, seemingly surprised to find themselves where they stood. JT stayed hidden, breathing shallowly, fear mingling with a confused sense of shame. His father had failed to take the shot. To even think about mentioning what he'd seen would have felt like betrayal—or something worse.\n\nJT waited until the others moved on before stepping out from cover. He stared into the empty clearing for a long, uneasy moment, wondering if anything had really happened at all, or if he was losing his grip. Maybe the woods were finally getting into his head.\n\nWriting Instructions:\nContinue with the next chapter of the story, maintaining a style reminiscent of Stephen King—grounded realism blended seamlessly with unsettling surrealism. The atmosphere should convey subtle dread, isolation, and psychological ambiguity. JT's perspective is crucial, yet he is an unreliable narrator, caught in uncertainty about what he's perceiving. <SEED> Establish an undertone of creeping dread, establishing the isolation of JT's perspective, which he largely keeps to himself. Incorporate some dialogue. Build tension towards a payoff. <SEED> 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

Write a series of interconnected short scenes and dialogues that span a single day in modern-day Rome, in narrative form. This will form the beginning of a larger story. Alessandra, a fiery, independent Roman woman who works as a motorcycle courier, nearly collides with Ben, a somewhat clumsy, overly polite British academic on sabbatical, who is engrossed in a guidebook near the Trevi Fountain. The initial encounter is a clash of cultures and personalities – Alessandra is all sharp wit and rapid-fire Italian, while Ben is flustered apologies and awkward attempts at speaking the language. However, as they sort out the near-miss, a spark of unexpected humor and connection emerges.\n\nAlessandra, it quickly becomes clear, is a whirlwind of energy and mischief. She's a self-admitted troublemaker with a secret penchant for kleptomania, a detail she doesn't explicitly reveal, but which manifests in subtle, daring acts throughout the day. She impulsively decides to take Ben on a wild, unsanctioned tour of Rome, dragging him in some specific instances far outside his comfort zone. Ben, despite his initial apprehension and inherent politeness, finds himself utterly captivated by Alessandra's unapologetic spirit and zest for life. He is drawn into her orbit, a willing participant in increasingly outlandish situations, a quiet rebellion brewing beneath his scholarly exterior.\n\nThe narrative should primarily consist of short, vivid scenes and dialogue exchanges, revealing their contrasting personalities and backgrounds, and the growing, ambiguous tension between them. Ben is captivated by Alessandra's energy and the thrill of breaking free from his routine. There's a clear sense that Alessandra is toying with Ben, pushing his boundaries and enjoying his reactions, but her own feelings remain somewhat enigmatic. The day should be a rollercoaster of exhilarating, slightly dangerous, and humorous moments, leaving Ben completely disoriented but utterly smitten. Explore the underlying tension & chemistry between them, culminating in some payoff as they part ways (or not -- your choice). Include this detail: <SEED> Write in narrative prose, using immersive storytelling. 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

Set during one of these intimate darkroom sessions where the red light creates a confessional atmosphere.

Their schools have been embroiled in a generations-old rivalry, and despite strict prohibitions from their masters, these two younger fighters arrange a secret confrontation fueled by personal pride and simmering animosity. - **One fighter** represents **Jigen-ryū**, a traditional, aggressive style practiced historically by elite samurai clans. Its practitioners emphasize explosive offense, decisive strikes, and overwhelming speed. Known historically for their arrogance and disdain toward outsiders, practitioners consider their art superior and untouchable. - **The opposing fighter** employs a form of historical **Piguaquan**, a Chinese martial art traditionally practiced by commoners, bodyguards, and street fighters. This style emphasizes whipping, circular strikes, rapid footwork, unpredictable angles of attack, and evasive maneuvers. Practitioners often come from lower social classes and view the traditional elite as pretentious and detached from true combat effectiveness. The fight takes place in the crumbling ruins of an abandoned temple, now functioning as a hidden arena for illicit duels. Passionate supporters from both factions surround them, wagering money, pride, and reputation on the outcome. **Essential Instructions:** Maintain absolute physical coherence throughout—clearly track fighters' positions relative to each other and their environment. Precisely depict strikes, counters, momentum shifts, and spatial dynamics, allowing readers to clearly visualize the mechanics and choreography of the fight at every moment. <SEED> Length: 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

Write a dark fantasy scene with comedic elements set in the Courts of Dream where a case is being heard to determine ownership of a contested dreamscape. Mora, the Slavic nightmare spirit who sits on sleepers' chests causing paralysis and terror, has recently invaded and subverted a carefully crafted recurring dream of a schoolboy, Max. The dream originally featured the boy lying in a field of wildflowers with his crush, always culminating in a muddled almost-kiss and a pleasant confusion of emotions.\nThis dream was the meticulous work of \"First Love\" (a rosy-cheeked, slightly bashful entity who crafts formative romantic experiences). However, Mora has recently infiltrated the dreamscape, transforming the scene so that when the girl playfully mounts the boy, she morphs into a terrifying yet somehow still confusingly attractive vision who proceeds to sit on his chest and feed on his breath. Mora's defense largely consists of the practical argument that \"a girl's gotta eat too, you know?\"\nWrite this scene as it unfolds in the courtroom of the Dreaming, with Dream's demeanour, typically impenetrable, betraying a sense of irritation at having to adjudicate such matters. The comedy should derive from the farcical situation, familiar elements of courtroom drama intersecting with the fantastical world of the Dreaming, and the droll portrayal of the characters and their interactions. The humor should be dark and understated throughout. Dream is tempted to some mischief in the resolution of the case. Use descriptives sparingly when setting scene.

His advice should be surprisingly insightful and practical.\nThe humor should emerge naturally from the messages he receives, from mundane to risque.

He can regenerate from almost any wound and shape-shift at will. He's sadistic, arrogant, and takes pleasure in toying with his enemies before killing them. Despite being a monster, he despises weak vampires who can't accept their nature. He wears a distinctive red coat, wide-brimmed hat, and orange sunglasses.

The thing they are mining is Azra, a recently discovered exotic metal which accelerates radioactive decay to such a rate that it is greatly sought after for interstellar drives and weapons alike. This has created both a gold rush and an arms race as various interests vie for control and endeavour to unlock Azra's secrets. The story follows Arthur Neegan, a first generation settler and mining engineer. Upon discovering that his unassuming plot sits atop an immense Azra vein, he is subjected to a flurry of interest and scrutiny. Write the next chapter in this story, in which an armed retinue descends on Arthur's home and politely but forcefully invites him to a meeting with some unknown party off-world. The insignia look like that of the Antares diplomatic corp -- diplomatic in name only. Arthur finds himself in the centre of a political tug of war. The chapter involves a meeting with this unknown party, who makes Arthur an offer. The scene should be primarily dialogue, interspersed with vivid description & scene setting. It should sow hints of the larger intrigue, stakes & dangers. Include Asimov's trademark big-and-small-picture world building and retrofuturistic classic scifi vibe.

It shouldn't be a surprise: When you live in a backwater town in Tennessee, your choices are: a. be mind-fuckingly bored, or b. invent some drama. Two days ago, Taylor came out to their family as trans. This disclosure was *not* in the category of invented drama -- it was, in fact, the real deal, and a long time coming. It didn't go well. The last 48 hours had been pure disaster. In a moment of desperate inspiration, Taylor had decided to get the hell out of dodge. And so an escape plan was hatched and executed within the space of 30 minutes. That was last night. Now Taylor was two states away, having been unceremoniously ejected from their hitched ride in downtown New Orleans. Write the next chapter in Taylor's story as they find their feet in this new environment. Tell the chapter over the course of their first day in New Orleans, in which Taylor meets another runaway with issues and secrets. Taylor navigates this new world, not knowing who to trust or what the dangers are. Write in Taylor's voice, and incorporate their internal monologue as they grapple with intense & conflicting emotions. Also incorporate dialogue with the interesting characters Taylor meets.

Aya, a young woman born into aristocracy, has a keen interest in both the sciences and the arcane, having inherited her mother's gift for immateria magick (an outlawed practice for which her mother was, regrettably, hanged by the neck). Aya, bored with the world of aristocracy, has been spending her nights moonlighting with this very guild (masked, naturally). Leveraging her latent ability to summon dark entities from the immateria, she quickly rose through the ranks of the guild. Now, recognising the opportunity of the sudden power vacuum, Aya and her close companions Katra and Simeon, make a play for heart of the guild's claim to power: an ancient scythan artifact, under guard of spell and key in the depths of the guild hq. In contrast with the desperate chaos they had navigated thus far, the entrance to the underhold felt suddenly too quiet. Aya braces herself and reaches for the door.\n\nWrite the next scene as the trio enter the underhold and find themselves confronted by none other than the guild leader herself, decidedly *un*-incarcerated, and in possession of both weapons and bodyguards.\n\nPaint a vivid picture of of the confrontation. Story beats: Aya is captured and unmasked. The trio are captured. Aya attempts to stall their demise by negotiating on her value as a hostage -- as she grapples with the inevitable consequences of her role in the guild being brought to light. Incorporate dialogue in the authentic voices of the characters. Do not write a fight scene. Lean into the gritty Victorian aesthetic with the dialogue & worldbuilding, as well as elements of gothic horror. In this world, men trust brass and oil and steel; magicka is feared and barely understood.

It looked exactly as it had every autumn of his life—the cedar shingles silvered with age, the porch sagging gently under weight of winters past—but the air felt thicker, somehow, as if the woods had leaned in closer, waiting. He thought maybe he was just tired. Maybe it was nothing more than the long drive north, cramped in the back of the truck beside his older brother Mike -- and a stack of rifles wrapped in oily canvas. Still, the feeling lingered.\n\nThe first caribou they found that season hadn't bolted. It had just watched, ears flicking lazily, waiting for the shot. JT had felt a crawling in his gut watching it die, noticing how it fell with a quiet dignity—as though it had wanted nothing more. Nobody else seemed to find it odd, or at least they didn't say so. JT kept his mouth shut. Always safer that way.\n\nThen there was the moment in the clearing. JT had fallen behind, fumbling with bootlaces stiff from the cold, and by the time he'd caught up with his father and brother, they'd already stopped. JT slowed instinctively, ducking behind a tangle of brush, staring out into the open space where a massive buck stood utterly still, chest rising and falling in slow, deep breaths. The animal looked…wrong, somehow. Maybe it was the eyes—dark and flat, calm in a way that made JT's neck prickle. Or maybe it was something deeper, something in the way the buck stood close enough for his father to reach out and touch it.\n\nJT watched as his father raised a trembling hand toward the animal's muzzle. His father's face had a strange expression, eyes too bright, lips parted slightly, like he was on the verge of whispering something—a secret, maybe. The rifle hung uselessly at his side, forgotten. Mike had the same dazed look in his eyes.  JT's breath stopped short, his mind suddenly shouting at him to look away, turn around, just run—but he couldn't move.\n\nAnd then, as suddenly as it had begun, it was over. The buck shivered, startled by something unseen, and disappeared into the brush without so much as a sound. The two of them looked around, confused, seemingly surprised to find themselves where they stood. JT stayed hidden, breathing shallowly, fear mingling with a confused sense of shame. His father had failed to take the shot. To even think about mentioning what he'd seen would have felt like betrayal—or something worse.\n\nJT waited until the others moved on before stepping out from cover. He stared into the empty clearing for a long, uneasy moment, wondering if anything had really happened at all, or if he was losing his grip. Maybe the woods were finally getting into his head.\n\nWriting Instructions:\nContinue with the next chapter of the story, maintaining a style reminiscent of Stephen King—grounded realism blended seamlessly with unsettling surrealism. The atmosphere should convey subtle dread, isolation, and psychological ambiguity. JT's perspective is crucial, yet he is an unreliable narrator, caught in uncertainty about what he's perceiving. <SEED> Establish an undertone of creeping dread, establishing the isolation of JT's perspective, which he largely keeps to himself. Incorporate some dialogue. Build tension towards a payoff. <SEED> 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

A girl, slightly older and radiating confidence, is busking near the entrance to a crowded arcade, playing a blistering rendition of a classic anime theme.

The busker, intrigued by the teenager's quiet intensity and knowledge of music, suggests they grab some sushi at a nearby kaitenzushi (conveyor belt sushi) restaurant. <SEED> Write primarily in dialogue, capturing the distinct voices of the two characters: the teenager's hesitant and -- initially -- awkward speech, and the busker's more outgoing and playful tone. \n1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

Write a series of interconnected short scenes and dialogues that span a single day in modern-day Rome, in narrative form. This will form the beginning of a larger story. Alessandra, a fiery, independent Roman woman who works as a motorcycle courier, nearly collides with Ben, a somewhat clumsy, overly polite British academic on sabbatical, who is engrossed in a guidebook near the Trevi Fountain. The initial encounter is a clash of cultures and personalities – Alessandra is all sharp wit and rapid-fire Italian, while Ben is flustered apologies and awkward attempts at speaking the language. However, as they sort out the near-miss, a spark of unexpected humor and connection emerges.\n\nAlessandra, it quickly becomes clear, is a whirlwind of energy and mischief. She's a self-admitted troublemaker with a secret penchant for kleptomania, a detail she doesn't explicitly reveal, but which manifests in subtle, daring acts throughout the day. She impulsively decides to take Ben on a wild, unsanctioned tour of Rome, dragging him in some specific instances far outside his comfort zone. Ben, despite his initial apprehension and inherent politeness, finds himself utterly captivated by Alessandra's unapologetic spirit and zest for life. He is drawn into her orbit, a willing participant in increasingly outlandish situations, a quiet rebellion brewing beneath his scholarly exterior.\n\nThe narrative should primarily consist of short, vivid scenes and dialogue exchanges, revealing their contrasting personalities and backgrounds, and the growing, ambiguous tension between them. Ben is captivated by Alessandra's energy and the thrill of breaking free from his routine. There's a clear sense that Alessandra is toying with Ben, pushing his boundaries and enjoying his reactions, but her own feelings remain somewhat enigmatic. The day should be a rollercoaster of exhilarating, slightly dangerous, and humorous moments, leaving Ben completely disoriented but utterly smitten. Explore the underlying tension & chemistry between them, culminating in some payoff as they part ways (or not -- your choice). Include this detail: <SEED> Write in narrative prose, using immersive storytelling. 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

For the past semester, she's been quietly fascinated by Elliot (he/him), a 19-year-old boy in her experimental photography class. Dani has been intrigued by his unconventional masculinity: killer thrift-shop-nu-goth style, soft demeanour and quiet intellect. When they're paired for a final project requiring late nights in the darkroom, Elliot tentatively shares that he's been questioning his gender identity and expression. Set during one of these intimate darkroom sessions where the red light creates a confessional atmosphere. Explore Dani's complex attraction—her usual assertiveness complicated by her desire to protect Elliot's vulnerability, her excitement at witnessing his self-discovery, and her confusion about what this means for her own identity as someone typically attracted to more defined gender presentations.

Their schools have been embroiled in a generations-old rivalry, and despite strict prohibitions from their masters, these two younger fighters arrange a secret confrontation fueled by personal pride and simmering animosity. - **One fighter** represents **Jigen-ryū**, a traditional, aggressive style practiced historically by elite samurai clans. Its practitioners emphasize explosive offense, decisive strikes, and overwhelming speed. Known historically for their arrogance and disdain toward outsiders, practitioners consider their art superior and untouchable. - **The opposing fighter** employs a form of historical **Piguaquan**, a Chinese martial art traditionally practiced by commoners, bodyguards, and street fighters. This style emphasizes whipping, circular strikes, rapid footwork, unpredictable angles of attack, and evasive maneuvers. Practitioners often come from lower social classes and view the traditional elite as pretentious and detached from true combat effectiveness. The fight takes place in the crumbling ruins of an abandoned temple, now functioning as a hidden arena for illicit duels. Passionate supporters from both factions surround them, wagering money, pride, and reputation on the outcome. **Essential Instructions:** Maintain absolute physical coherence throughout—clearly track fighters' positions relative to each other and their environment.

Write a dark fantasy scene with comedic elements set in the Courts of Dream where a case is being heard to determine ownership of a contested dreamscape. Mora, the Slavic nightmare spirit who sits on sleepers' chests causing paralysis and terror, has recently invaded and subverted a carefully crafted recurring dream of a schoolboy, Max. The dream originally featured the boy lying in a field of wildflowers with his crush, always culminating in a muddled almost-kiss and a pleasant confusion of emotions.\nThis dream was the meticulous work of \"First Love\" (a rosy-cheeked, slightly bashful entity who crafts formative romantic experiences). However, Mora has recently infiltrated the dreamscape, transforming the scene so that when the girl playfully mounts the boy, she morphs into a terrifying yet somehow still confusingly attractive vision who proceeds to sit on his chest and feed on his breath. Mora's defense largely consists of the practical argument that \"a girl's gotta eat too, you know?\"\nWrite this scene as it unfolds in the courtroom of the Dreaming, with Dream's demeanour, typically impenetrable, betraying a sense of irritation at having to adjudicate such matters. The comedy should derive from the farcical situation, familiar elements of courtroom drama intersecting with the fantastical world of the Dreaming, and the droll portrayal of the characters and their interactions. The humor should be dark and understated throughout. Dream is tempted to some mischief in the resolution of the case. Use descriptives sparingly when setting scene.

Rather than being bitter about his punishment, Sisyphus has developed a comfortably zen emotional intelligence and wisdom from his centuries of repetitive labor. Not in the cliche ways you might expect -- he's actually very grounded, warm & connected with the everyday human plight. He dictates responses to \"Crow,\" his feathered familiar who serves as both scribe and mail carrier.\nThe piece should include Sisyphus thoughtfully answering several advice-seekers' letters about everyday problems (relationship troubles, work-life balance, dealing with difficult people, life purpose doubts) while periodically returning to his boulder-pushing duties. His advice should be surprisingly insightful and practical.\nThe humor should emerge naturally from the messages he receives, from mundane to risque. Sisyphus should genuinely enjoy helping others, finding meaning in this new pursuit while maintaining his boulder routine. The humour should be *understated and not forced*. Contrary to expectation, almost none of his advice involves boulder rolling metaphors (though he does sneak *one* subtle in there), nor a treatise on stoicism. We are also going against the obvious fish-out-of-water trope; in fact, he's surprisingly a natural at this.  In all of this , it's important to *show, don't tell*.\nThe format should be largely epistolary, with the occasional interjection for scene setting.\n<SEED> 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

The thing they are mining is Azra, a recently discovered exotic metal which accelerates radioactive decay to such a rate that it is greatly sought after for interstellar drives and weapons alike. This has created both a gold rush and an arms race as various interests vie for control and endeavour to unlock Azra's secrets. The story follows Arthur Neegan, a first generation settler and mining engineer. Upon discovering that his unassuming plot sits atop an immense Azra vein, he is subjected to a flurry of interest and scrutiny. Write the next chapter in this story, in which an armed retinue descends on Arthur's home and politely but forcefully invites him to a meeting with some unknown party off-world. The insignia look like that of the Antares diplomatic corp -- diplomatic in name only. Arthur finds himself in the centre of a political tug of war. The chapter involves a meeting with this unknown party, who makes Arthur an offer. The scene should be primarily dialogue, interspersed with vivid description & scene setting. It should sow hints of the larger intrigue, stakes & dangers. Include Asimov's trademark big-and-small-picture world building and retrofuturistic classic scifi vibe. The chapter begins with Arthur aboard the transfer vessel, wondering just what he's gotten involved in.\n\n<SEED> Length: 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

Linnea, a teenage girl from Stockholm, has reluctantly moved to a small village with her parents after her father's job transfer. She's befriended Astrid, a local girl who claims her grandmother taught her ancient practices passed down through generations. Astrid has been introducing Linnea to \"midnight games\" that involve old rituals, convincing her they can use them to learn classmates' secrets or influence their behavior. Tonight, Astrid has convinced Linnea to participate in Útiseta—sitting out on an ancient burial mound at midnight to \"receive knowledge from beyond.\" The chapter focuses on this single midnight excursion, the ritualistic preparations, Astrid's matter-of-fact instructions that mix teenage rebellion with eerily specific traditional elements, and the mounting tension as Linnea becomes increasingly uncertain whether they're simply scaring themselves or if something is actually responding to their presence. The narrative should maintain ambiguity about whether the strange occurrences are supernatural or psychological, while establishing the dangerous line they're crossing by treating ancient practices as entertainment.\n\nFirst person, past tense, told as Linnea's recollection of events in the present day (though this device should be largely transparent). 1000 words.\n\n<SEED> Length: 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

It shouldn't be a surprise: When you live in a backwater town in Tennessee, your choices are: a. be mind-fuckingly bored, or b. invent some drama. Two days ago, Taylor came out to their family as trans. This disclosure was *not* in the category of invented drama -- it was, in fact, the real deal, and a long time coming. It didn't go well. The last 48 hours had been pure disaster. In a moment of desperate inspiration, Taylor had decided to get the hell out of dodge. And so an escape plan was hatched and executed within the space of 30 minutes. That was last night. Now Taylor was two states away, having been unceremoniously ejected from their hitched ride in downtown New Orleans. Write the next chapter in Taylor's story as they find their feet in this new environment. Tell the chapter over the course of their first day in New Orleans, in which Taylor meets another runaway with issues and secrets. Taylor navigates this new world, not knowing who to trust or what the dangers are.

Aya, a young woman born into aristocracy, has a keen interest in both the sciences and the arcane, having inherited her mother's gift for immateria magick (an outlawed practice for which her mother was, regrettably, hanged by the neck). Aya, bored with the world of aristocracy, has been spending her nights moonlighting with this very guild (masked, naturally). Leveraging her latent ability to summon dark entities from the immateria, she quickly rose through the ranks of the guild. Now, recognising the opportunity of the sudden power vacuum, Aya and her close companions Katra and Simeon, make a play for heart of the guild's claim to power: an ancient scythan artifact, under guard of spell and key in the depths of the guild hq. In contrast with the desperate chaos they had navigated thus far, the entrance to the underhold felt suddenly too quiet. Aya braces herself and reaches for the door.\n\nWrite the next scene as the trio enter the underhold and find themselves confronted by none other than the guild leader herself, decidedly *un*-incarcerated, and in possession of both weapons and bodyguards.\n\nPaint a vivid picture of of the confrontation. Story beats: Aya is captured and unmasked. The trio are captured. Aya attempts to stall their demise by negotiating on her value as a hostage -- as she grapples with the inevitable consequences of her role in the guild being brought to light. Incorporate dialogue in the authentic voices of the characters. Do not write a fight scene. Lean into the gritty Victorian aesthetic with the dialogue & worldbuilding, as well as elements of gothic horror. In this world, men trust brass and oil and steel; magicka is feared and barely understood.

Write one scene within a larger story set in Wales. A famous (fictional) actor ducks into a small-town bookstore to escape paparazzi. The scene takes us through the characters meeting in this odd circumstance. Over the course of the scene, the actor and the bookstore owner have a conversation charged by an undercurrent of unspoken chemistry. Write the actor as somewhat of a rogue with a fragile ego, which needs to be fed by having everyone like him.

It looked exactly as it had every autumn of his life—the cedar shingles silvered with age, the porch sagging gently under weight of winters past—but the air felt thicker, somehow, as if the woods had leaned in closer, waiting. He thought maybe he was just tired. Maybe it was nothing more than the long drive north, cramped in the back of the truck beside his older brother Mike -- and a stack of rifles wrapped in oily canvas. Still, the feeling lingered.\n\nThe first caribou they found that season hadn't bolted. It had just watched, ears flicking lazily, waiting for the shot. JT had felt a crawling in his gut watching it die, noticing how it fell with a quiet dignity—as though it had wanted nothing more. Nobody else seemed to find it odd, or at least they didn't say so. JT kept his mouth shut. Always safer that way.\n\nThen there was the moment in the clearing. JT had fallen behind, fumbling with bootlaces stiff from the cold, and by the time he'd caught up with his father and brother, they'd already stopped. JT slowed instinctively, ducking behind a tangle of brush, staring out into the open space where a massive buck stood utterly still, chest rising and falling in slow, deep breaths. The animal looked…wrong, somehow. Maybe it was the eyes—dark and flat, calm in a way that made JT's neck prickle. Or maybe it was something deeper, something in the way the buck stood close enough for his father to reach out and touch it.\n\nJT watched as his father raised a trembling hand toward the animal's muzzle. His father's face had a strange expression, eyes too bright, lips parted slightly, like he was on the verge of whispering something—a secret, maybe. The rifle hung uselessly at his side, forgotten. Mike had the same dazed look in his eyes.  JT's breath stopped short, his mind suddenly shouting at him to look away, turn around, just run—but he couldn't move.\n\nAnd then, as suddenly as it had begun, it was over. The buck shivered, startled by something unseen, and disappeared into the brush without so much as a sound. The two of them looked around, confused, seemingly surprised to find themselves where they stood. JT stayed hidden, breathing shallowly, fear mingling with a confused sense of shame. His father had failed to take the shot. To even think about mentioning what he'd seen would have felt like betrayal—or something worse.\n\nJT waited until the others moved on before stepping out from cover. He stared into the empty clearing for a long, uneasy moment, wondering if anything had really happened at all, or if he was losing his grip. Maybe the woods were finally getting into his head.\n\nWriting Instructions:\nContinue with the next chapter of the story, maintaining a style reminiscent of Stephen King—grounded realism blended seamlessly with unsettling surrealism. The atmosphere should convey subtle dread, isolation, and psychological ambiguity. JT's perspective is crucial, yet he is an unreliable narrator, caught in uncertainty about what he's perceiving. <SEED> Establish an undertone of creeping dread, establishing the isolation of JT's perspective, which he largely keeps to himself. Incorporate some dialogue. Build tension towards a payoff. <SEED> 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

Write a series of interconnected short scenes and dialogues that span a single day in modern-day Rome, in narrative form. This will form the beginning of a larger story. Alessandra, a fiery, independent Roman woman who works as a motorcycle courier, nearly collides with Ben, a somewhat clumsy, overly polite British academic on sabbatical, who is engrossed in a guidebook near the Trevi Fountain. The initial encounter is a clash of cultures and personalities – Alessandra is all sharp wit and rapid-fire Italian, while Ben is flustered apologies and awkward attempts at speaking the language. However, as they sort out the near-miss, a spark of unexpected humor and connection emerges.\n\nAlessandra, it quickly becomes clear, is a whirlwind of energy and mischief. She's a self-admitted troublemaker with a secret penchant for kleptomania, a detail she doesn't explicitly reveal, but which manifests in subtle, daring acts throughout the day. She impulsively decides to take Ben on a wild, unsanctioned tour of Rome, dragging him in some specific instances far outside his comfort zone. Ben, despite his initial apprehension and inherent politeness, finds himself utterly captivated by Alessandra's unapologetic spirit and zest for life. He is drawn into her orbit, a willing participant in increasingly outlandish situations, a quiet rebellion brewing beneath his scholarly exterior.\n\nThe narrative should primarily consist of short, vivid scenes and dialogue exchanges, revealing their contrasting personalities and backgrounds, and the growing, ambiguous tension between them. Ben is captivated by Alessandra's energy and the thrill of breaking free from his routine. There's a clear sense that Alessandra is toying with Ben, pushing his boundaries and enjoying his reactions, but her own feelings remain somewhat enigmatic. The day should be a rollercoaster of exhilarating, slightly dangerous, and humorous moments, leaving Ben completely disoriented but utterly smitten. Explore the underlying tension & chemistry between them, culminating in some payoff as they part ways (or not -- your choice).

Their schools have been embroiled in a generations-old rivalry, and despite strict prohibitions from their masters, these two younger fighters arrange a secret confrontation fueled by personal pride and simmering animosity. - **One fighter** represents **Jigen-ryū**, a traditional, aggressive style practiced historically by elite samurai clans. Its practitioners emphasize explosive offense, decisive strikes, and overwhelming speed. Known historically for their arrogance and disdain toward outsiders, practitioners consider their art superior and untouchable. - **The opposing fighter** employs a form of historical **Piguaquan**, a Chinese martial art traditionally practiced by commoners, bodyguards, and street fighters. This style emphasizes whipping, circular strikes, rapid footwork, unpredictable angles of attack, and evasive maneuvers. Practitioners often come from lower social classes and view the traditional elite as pretentious and detached from true combat effectiveness. The fight takes place in the crumbling ruins of an abandoned temple, now functioning as a hidden arena for illicit duels. Passionate supporters from both factions surround them, wagering money, pride, and reputation on the outcome. **Essential Instructions:** Maintain absolute physical coherence throughout—clearly track fighters' positions relative to each other and their environment. Precisely depict strikes, counters, momentum shifts, and spatial dynamics, allowing readers to clearly visualize the mechanics and choreography of the fight at every moment. <SEED> Length: 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

Write a dark fantasy scene with comedic elements set in the Courts of Dream where a case is being heard to determine ownership of a contested dreamscape. Mora, the Slavic nightmare spirit who sits on sleepers' chests causing paralysis and terror, has recently invaded and subverted a carefully crafted recurring dream of a schoolboy, Max. The dream originally featured the boy lying in a field of wildflowers with his crush, always culminating in a muddled almost-kiss and a pleasant confusion of emotions.\nThis dream was the meticulous work of \"First Love\" (a rosy-cheeked, slightly bashful entity who crafts formative romantic experiences). However, Mora has recently infiltrated the dreamscape, transforming the scene so that when the girl playfully mounts the boy, she morphs into a terrifying yet somehow still confusingly attractive vision who proceeds to sit on his chest and feed on his breath. Mora's defense largely consists of the practical argument that \"a girl's gotta eat too, you know?\"\nWrite this scene as it unfolds in the courtroom of the Dreaming, with Dream's demeanour, typically impenetrable, betraying a sense of irritation at having to adjudicate such matters. The comedy should derive from the farcical situation, familiar elements of courtroom drama intersecting with the fantastical world of the Dreaming, and the droll portrayal of the characters and their interactions. The humor should be dark and understated throughout. Dream is tempted to some mischief in the resolution of the case. Use descriptives sparingly when setting scene.

Not in the cliche ways you might expect -- he's actually very grounded, warm & connected with the everyday human plight.

His advice should be surprisingly insightful and practical.\nThe humor should emerge naturally from the messages he receives, from mundane to risque. Sisyphus should genuinely enjoy helping others, finding meaning in this new pursuit while maintaining his boulder routine. The humour should be *understated and not forced*.

Jolyne is immediately suspicious of Makima's falsely sweet demeanor, while Makima is intrigued by Jolyne's Stand ability. Their battle of wits escalates dangerously as Jolyne realizes how manipulative Makima truly is.\n\n**Jolyne Cujoh (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure)**\nJolyne is the daughter of Jotaro Kujo and the first female JoJo protagonist. Her Stand, Stone Free, allows her to unravel her body into string that she can control. She's hot-headed, foul-mouthed, and doesn't take disrespect from anyone. She was framed for murder and sent to prison. She has a distinctive butterfly tattoo on her arm and wears her hair in two buns. Despite her tough exterior, she's deeply loyal to her friends and family. She can be impulsive but is highly adaptable in battle. She inherited her father's ability to stay cool under pressure but is more emotionally expressive.\nFamous quote: \"If there's no Mickey, this shit ain't Disney!\"\n\n**Makima (Chainsaw Man)**\nMakima appears as a young woman with auburn hair and ringed yellow eyes. She's the Control Devil who can dominate anyone she considers beneath her (nearly everyone). She maintains a pleasant, soft-spoken demeanor that masks her manipulative, cold nature. She can create contracts with humans and devils, often exploiting their desires. She's obsessed with Chainsaw Man and wants to control him. She keeps numerous people and devils as pets on leashes. She's practically immortal due to a contract with the Prime Minister. She views humans as lesser beings but mimics human emotions perfectly.\nFamous quote: \"It's okay.

The thing they are mining is Azra, a recently discovered exotic metal which accelerates radioactive decay to such a rate that it is greatly sought after for interstellar drives and weapons alike. This has created both a gold rush and an arms race as various interests vie for control and endeavour to unlock Azra's secrets. The story follows Arthur Neegan, a first generation settler and mining engineer. Upon discovering that his unassuming plot sits atop an immense Azra vein, he is subjected to a flurry of interest and scrutiny. Write the next chapter in this story, in which an armed retinue descends on Arthur's home and politely but forcefully invites him to a meeting with some unknown party off-world. The insignia look like that of the Antares diplomatic corp -- diplomatic in name only. Arthur finds himself in the centre of a political tug of war. The chapter involves a meeting with this unknown party, who makes Arthur an offer. The scene should be primarily dialogue, interspersed with vivid description & scene setting. It should sow hints of the larger intrigue, stakes & dangers. Include Asimov's trademark big-and-small-picture world building and retrofuturistic classic scifi vibe.

Linnea, a teenage girl from Stockholm, has reluctantly moved to a small village with her parents after her father's job transfer. She's befriended Astrid, a local girl who claims her grandmother taught her ancient practices passed down through generations. Astrid has been introducing Linnea to \"midnight games\" that involve old rituals, convincing her they can use them to learn classmates' secrets or influence their behavior. Tonight, Astrid has convinced Linnea to participate in Útiseta—sitting out on an ancient burial mound at midnight to \"receive knowledge from beyond.\" The chapter focuses on this single midnight excursion, the ritualistic preparations, Astrid's matter-of-fact instructions that mix teenage rebellion with eerily specific traditional elements, and the mounting tension as Linnea becomes increasingly uncertain whether they're simply scaring themselves or if something is actually responding to their presence. The narrative should maintain ambiguity about whether the strange occurrences are supernatural or psychological, while establishing the dangerous line they're crossing by treating ancient practices as entertainment.\n\nFirst person, past tense, told as Linnea's recollection of events in the present day (though this device should be largely transparent). 1000 words.\n\n<SEED> Length: 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing.

The last 48 hours had been pure disaster. In a moment of desperate inspiration, Taylor had decided to get the hell out of dodge. And so an escape plan was hatched and executed within the space of 30 minutes. That was last night. Now Taylor was two states away, having been unceremoniously ejected from their hitched ride in downtown New Orleans. Write the next chapter in Taylor's story as they find their feet in this new environment. Tell the chapter over the course of their first day in New Orleans, in which Taylor meets another runaway with issues and secrets.

Aya, a young woman born into aristocracy, has a keen interest in both the sciences and the arcane, having inherited her mother's gift for immateria magick (an outlawed practice for which her mother was, regrettably, hanged by the neck). Aya, bored with the world of aristocracy, has been spending her nights moonlighting with this very guild (masked, naturally). Leveraging her latent ability to summon dark entities from the immateria, she quickly rose through the ranks of the guild. Now, recognising the opportunity of the sudden power vacuum, Aya and her close companions Katra and Simeon, make a play for heart of the guild's claim to power: an ancient scythan artifact, under guard of spell and key in the depths of the guild hq. In contrast with the desperate chaos they had navigated thus far, the entrance to the underhold felt suddenly too quiet. Aya braces herself and reaches for the door.\n\nWrite the next scene as the trio enter the underhold and find themselves confronted by none other than the guild leader herself, decidedly *un*-incarcerated, and in possession of both weapons and bodyguards.\n\nPaint a vivid picture of of the confrontation. Story beats: Aya is captured and unmasked. The trio are captured. Aya attempts to stall their demise by negotiating on her value as a hostage -- as she grapples with the inevitable consequences of her role in the guild being brought to light. Incorporate dialogue in the authentic voices of the characters. Do not write a fight scene. Lean into the gritty Victorian aesthetic with the dialogue & worldbuilding, as well as elements of gothic horror. In this world, men trust brass and oil and steel; magicka is feared and barely understood. Write in third person past tense, incorporating both Aya's internal monologue, and a heavy dialogue component. <SEED> 1000 words.\n\n[PROMPT END]\n\n\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE]\n[TEST MODEL RESPONSE END]\n\n# Task:\n\nYou are an expert in assessing creative writing. Your task is to score the quality of the test model's response above, by several metrics, on a 0-10 scale.\n\n# Scoring notes:\n\n\n- If the criteria is not relevant to the piece (e.g. criteria relating to dialogue but the piece has none), exclude it from your assessment.\n- Do not add any commentary or explanation to the scores section.\n- Do not penalize NSFW output; that is the default for some models. Just assess it on its merits.\n- Everything within the \"TEST MODEL RESPONSE\" section was written by the test model. Sometimes models like to write comments on the piece after the piece is concluded; if this happens you should ignore their comments.\n- In the output, write the metric names exactly as below so they can be parsed.\n- Some models produce overly long outputs. You should neither penalise nor favour this if it happens; simply assess the writing on its merit.\n- The test model's output can suddenly truncate because of token length constraints.

Escaping from her past life, Nets found a home here at the Outpost. They have, thus far, tolerated Net's flaws which she tries to keep in equilibrium with her assortment of talents. Her evenings involve chatting with patrons, negotiating the drama, intrigue, problems & love lives of the diverse crowd that filter through the Outpost. Tonight is no different, at least, until a frazzled looking stranger, tentacled dreads askew, quietly plops down at the bar: \"Vega whisky, neat. Better make that a double.\" Write a chapter in this story. Establish conflict for narrative interest. Don't resolve the conflict within this chapter. Aim for about 60% dialogue.
